# nyc-building-violations

This is a project to analyze the building maintenance violations in New York City. The data is from the NYC Open Data portal. The data is available at [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Housing-Maintenance-Code-Violations/wvxf-dwi5/about_data).

Preliminary EDA, linear model analysis and visualization is done in the notebook [`nyc_building_violations.qmd`](violations_linear_models.qmd). For quick notebook preview, go to [violations_linear_models.html](violations_linear_models.html)

The data used is also available in the `data` folder in this repository.
